/**
 * Bug B regression: incidental routed-domain URLs in a sub-agent's free-text
 * narration must NOT trigger URL verification (and therefore must NOT cause a
 * dead-URL retry that surfaces "something glitched, give me another go") when
 * the TASK never requested a reachable artifact/URL.
 *
 * A "build a static site in its own folder" task (no deploy/URL requested)
 * routinely has codex's exploratory narration surface incidental URLs — e.g.
 * an `/apps/<slug>/`-shaped URL it grepped out of skill code, a CDN link, or a
 * telemetry endpoint. Those are NOT deliverables. The verifier gate must key on
 * the task's own intent (it asked for a reachable artifact) or an explicit
 * deployment route the task set up — never on the mere shape of a URL that
 * appears in narration.
 *
 * The legitimate case ("deploy X and give me the live URL" → dead URL) must
 * still verify + flag.
