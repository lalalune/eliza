/**
 * Deterministic completion-residuals check: the machine-verifiable gate a task
 * must clear before `validating` may promote to `done`. Every other verdict in
 * the completion pipeline is judged text (the sub-agent's self-reported
 * envelope, the independent ACP verifier, the TEXT_SMALL judge) — this module
 * is the one leg that asks git directly, so a worker that "reports done" with
 * a dirty tree or unpushed commits is blocked on facts, not prose.
 *
 * Consumed by `OrchestratorTaskService.autoVerifyCompletion` (before any model
 * spend) and `validateTask` (before honoring a `passed: true` verdict; a human
 * override runs it too, recording what was overridden). Fail-closed for
 * repo-declaring tasks: when the task/session names a repo, a missing workdir
 * string, a missing/non-git directory, or a git/fs probe failure yields
 * `unverifiable` — never a silent pass. Tasks WITHOUT a declared repo (every
 * ACP session still gets an acp-scratch workdir, even a voice/Q&A task) probe
 * the workdir opportunistically: a real git worktree runs the git legs, a
 * scratch/non-git dir skips them, and the envelope-reported failing tests
 * always apply. Self-reported `residualRisks` are DISCLOSURE, not defects:
 * they never block promotion (blocking them taught workers to delete the
 * disclosure or burn the attempt cap) — they ride the snapshot as
 * `disclosedRisks` and surface as caveats in the user-facing completion.
 * `ELIZA_ORCHESTRATOR_RESIDUALS_GATE=0` disables the gate (mirrors the
 * `ELIZA_ORCHESTRATOR_AUTO_GOAL_VERIFY` flag convention).
