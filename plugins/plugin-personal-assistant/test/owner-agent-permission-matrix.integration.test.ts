/**
 * Consolidated OWNER vs AGENT permission-matrix harness (issue #8833 §2).
 *
 * Issue #8833 ("LifeOps split: complete live owner/agent connector and view
 * validation") calls for a single, repeatable harness that exercises the
 * owner-vs-agent permission matrix for the split LifeOps surface across the
 * nine states the issue enumerates, and that SKIPS CLEANLY when the live
 * accounts / env that the deeper connector smoke needs are absent.
 *
 * This file is that harness. It runs against a real `AgentRuntime` + PGLite +
 * the real LifeOps schema (no role mocks — unlike
 * `owner-action-handler-permissions.test.ts`, which mocks `@elizaos/agent` to
 * force the non-owner branch). Establishing genuine OWNER and non-owner
 * identities via `setEntityRole` lets the real role-resolution chain
 * (`hasRoleAccess` / `checkSenderRole` / `satisfiesRoleGate`) run end to end,
 * so the harness proves the actual gates, not a stub of them.
 *
 * Two enforcement paths are covered, matching the two paths the issue lists:
 *
 *   - Planned-tool execution path — the planner gates owner-only tool calls
 *     through `satisfiesRoleGate(userRoles, action.roleGate)` in
 *     `packages/core/src/runtime/execute-planned-tool-call.ts`. The harness
 *     asserts that gate directly against each owner-gated action's real
 *     `roleGate`.
 *   - Direct handler-invocation path — the action handlers guard at execution
 *     time via `hasLifeOpsAccess` → `hasOwnerAccess` → `hasRoleAccess`. The
 *     harness asserts that same `hasRoleAccess` chain for the resolved role.
 *
 * The "multiple grants where owner-side selection must win" state is exercised
 * against the real repository: seeding both an `owner`-side and an `agent`-side
 * grant for the same provider and asserting that the default owner-side lookup
 * resolves the owner grant.
 *
 * SKIP behavior: the harness is gated behind `LIFEOPS_PERMISSION_MATRIX=1`
 * (the env that signals the live accounts/devices from §1 are provisioned).
 * Without it, `describeIf(false)` renders one clean skipped suite — `it.skip`,
 * not a failure — so `bun run test` stays green in credential-free CI. See the
 * consolidated prerequisites + run instructions in
 * `docs/owner-agent-validation-matrix.md`.
