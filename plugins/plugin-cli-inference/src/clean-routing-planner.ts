/**
 * Clean-routing ACTION_PLANNER for the SAFE/CLI inference route.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The native-tool planner prompt (`packages/core/src/prompts/planner.ts` +
 * the rendered `planner_stage:` block + the `<response>` grammar) is written
 * for a provider that honors GBNF / native-tool / responseSchema enforcement.
 * Fed verbatim to `claude --print`, that grammar-heavy prompt reliably
 * confuses the model into ANSWERING the user's task inline (as Claude Code
 * would) instead of EMITTING a routing decision — the model reads "task: Plan
 * next native tool calls" plus a wall of decode-rules and treats it as a
 * coding instruction.
 *
 * Proven live: `claude --print --model claude-opus-4-8` given a CLEAN routing
 * prompt ("pick ONE action, output ONLY compact JSON {action,params}") routes
 * every turn type correctly, with grounded params, in eliza's voice. So claude
 * CAN plan — it just needs the routing task stated plainly and the action
 * universe handed to it as a short menu rather than as native tool schemas it
 * is told to "call".
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 * --------------
 * Rebuilds the planner call into the proven clean form BEFORE it reaches the
 * CLI:
 *   1. Extracts the action universe from `params.tools` (the per-action
 *      `ToolDefinition[]` the planner loop always forwards — each tool's `name`
 *      is the action name, `parameters` is its arg schema).
 *   2. Extracts the conversation transcript from `params.messages`, dropping
 *      the injected `planner_stage:` grammar block and any prior `<response>`
 *      scaffold so only real user/assistant/tool turns remain.
 *   3. Synthesizes a CLEAN routing system prompt + body (the proven template)
 *      and returns them as a fresh `GenerateTextParams` for `generateViaCli`.
 *
 * The handler returns the model's compact JSON verbatim. The planner loop's
 * text-mode parser (`parseJsonPlannerOutput` → `normalizeBarePlannerAction`)
 * accepts the bare `{"action": NAME, "params": {...}}` shape directly: it reads
 * the action name from `action`/`name` and the args from `params`/`parameters`,
 * and resolves REPLY / IGNORE / STOP as the universal terminal sentinels. No
 * change to core is required.
