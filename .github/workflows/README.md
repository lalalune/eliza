## Release Workflows

### Alpha Tags

Alpha version tags are tags only. They do not publish NPM packages, run packaging
CI, or create GitHub Release entries.

### NPM Beta/Production Packages (`release.yaml`)

Publishes one explicitly prepared, immutable TypeScript/JavaScript package
cohort to npm, verifies the entire cohort, then creates the exact Git tag and
GitHub Release. A tag push or an existing GitHub Release never starts npm
publication.

**Triggers:**

- Explicit reusable-workflow call with `source_sha`, canonical `source_ref`,
  `version`, `channel`, and the expected npm publisher username
- Manual dispatch with the same required identity
- Optional `candidate_run_id` resumes a prior candidate artifact without
  rebuilding or repacking it

**Packages:** The reviewed allowlist in
`packages/scripts/release-cohort.json`, including its complete runtime
workspace dependency closure.

## Test Workflows

### Linux Runner Policy

The heavy develop **test lanes** in `test.yml` run on the self-hosted
`self-hosted, hetzner-robot` pool (GitHub-hosted minutes are billing-frozen for
this org, #13481). Everything the **merge gate** depends on to *reach a
conclusion* stays GitHub-hosted so a drained fleet can never wedge develop:

- **Path classifiers** (`Classify changed paths`) across `test.yml`,
  `scenario-pr.yml`, `dev-smoke.yml`, `docker-ci-smoke.yml`,
  `mobile-build-smoke.yml`, `windows-dev-smoke.yml`, and
  `windows-desktop-preload-smoke.yml` run on `ubuntu-24.04`. They are git-diff +
  node scripts with no self-hosted needs; pinning them to the fleet (#8501) once
  left every downstream job queued indefinitely and gridlocked develop.
- **`ci-ok`** (the merge queue's sole required context), its
  `plugin-tests-status` roll-up, and the hosted **`merge-quality-gate`** all run
  on `ubuntu-24.04`.

Two SPOF guards, enforced by `packages/scripts/ci-merge-gate-contract.mjs` (run
in the `changes` job, #13617):

1. **Fleet-drain toggle.** Every self-hosted lane in `test.yml` reads
   `runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(vars.HETZNER_FLEET_ONLINE == 'false' && '["ubuntu-24.04"]' || '["self-hosted","hetzner-robot"]') }}`.
   Unset/anything-but-`false` keeps the current self-hosted placement; there is
   no way to probe fleet health from a `runs-on:` expression, so during an
   outage an admin sets repo **variable** `HETZNER_FLEET_ONLINE=false` once and
   the whole workflow falls back to hosted — one flip unblocks the entire queue
   instead of per-PR admin-bypass. Keep the runner-agnostic step hardening (no
   `sudo`-only install/cleanup) so lanes run on either runner type.
2. **Hosted quality parity.** `merge-quality-gate` runs the same lint /
   `format:check` / repo-wide `typecheck` / gitleaks secret scan that guard
   `main`, and `ci-ok` needs it — so a lint, type, format, or committed-secret
   regression is refused by the merge queue on develop, not just on `main`. It
   runs on `merge_group` + develop `push`. The lightweight `develop-pr.yml`
   lint job also runs `format:check`, so formatting fails on the PR even when a
   busy push wave supersedes post-merge quality runs (#15959).

CodeQL is a separate exception: trusted push, scheduled, and manual CodeQL runs
use `self-hosted, Linux, X64, hetzner-robot` because full JavaScript analysis is
disk-bound and has exhausted GitHub-hosted runners during the `PolynomialReDoS`
dataflow query. Pull-request CodeQL remains GitHub-hosted so forked code never
executes on self-hosted machines. Keep the full CodeQL query surface intact;
move capacity around rather than weakening security coverage. The CodeQL config
may ignore deliberately invalid negative-test fixtures, but not real source
files; those fixtures should stay covered by their owning tests.

GPU / KVM / macOS jobs (labels `gpu-cuda-12.6`, `kvm`, `eliza-e2e-macos`) are a
separate purpose-built fleet and are unaffected by this policy.

### PR Path Gates

PR workflows use `packages/scripts/ci-path-gate.mjs` to keep expensive lanes
targeted. Each classifier job writes a GitHub step summary showing:

- which files changed
- which lanes will run
- which path or label caused each lane to run

Maintainers can force specific lanes with labels:

| Label | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `ci:full` | Run every path-gated lane in workflows that honor the shared gate |
| `ci:e2e` / `ci:zero-key` | Run deterministic zero-key E2E lanes |
| `ci:scenario` | Run `scenario-pr.yml` deterministic scenario/browser E2E |
| `ci:server` | Run server tests |
| `ci:client` | Run client tests |
| `ci:plugins` | Run plugin tests |
| `ci:cloud` | Run cloud live E2E where secrets are configured |
| `ci:docker` | Run Docker CI smoke |
| `ci:mobile` / `ci:ios` / `ci:android` | Run mobile smoke, or one mobile platform |
| `ci:desktop` / `ci:windows` | Run desktop and Windows smoke lanes |
| `ci:dev-smoke` | Run the `bun run dev` onboarding smoke |

Push, scheduled, and manual runs keep their broader/default behavior; the path
gate mainly keeps PR feedback fast and explainable.

Why this exists:

- OSS contributors should get useful feedback quickly without waiting on
  unrelated mobile, Docker, desktop, Windows, or browser-heavy lanes.
- Maintainers should be able to see why a lane ran or skipped from the job
  summary, without reverse-engineering shell conditionals.
- The quality gate should stay equivalent for affected code. Path gates decide
  which surface is relevant; they do not replace the tests for that surface.
- Push, scheduled, and manual runs remain broad because they protect branch
  health, release readiness, and nightly confidence rather than one PR diff.

Quality contract:

- Any path-gated lane must be forced by `ci:full`.
- Every expensive lane needs a matching force label so maintainers can request
  coverage without pushing a no-op commit.
- Workflow, shared setup, toolchain, lockfile, and classifier changes should run
  the affected expensive lanes because they can change CI behavior even when
  product code did not move.
- The `Tests` workflow runs the classifier self-test before consuming classifier
  outputs. That self-test covers representative path matches and label forcing
  so a future edit cannot silently weaken the broadest PR test gate.
- When splitting a long lane, keep the same substantive commands unless the PR
  explicitly documents the safety reason for removing one.

Long deterministic E2E gates are split into named parallel slices for unit/UI
coverage, browser coverage, diagnostics, and scenario execution. The visible
`Zero-Key Deterministic E2E` check is an aggregate status over those slices, so
reviewers can see the failing surface without opening one giant serial log.

Plugin tests are also split across `TEST_SHARD=1/4` through `4/4` in the
`Tests` workflow. The root `test:plugins` script uses the cross-package runner
so shard membership is deterministic by package path, while the visible
`Plugin Tests` check remains an aggregate over the shard matrix.

Why the aggregate stays:

- Branch protection and reviewer muscle memory can keep using one stable check.
- The underlying slices can run in parallel and fail with precise names.
- Manual review becomes easier because a browser failure, diagnostics failure,
  or scenario-runner failure points at the relevant log immediately.

Related CI docs:

- `CHANGELOG.md` records workflow policy changes and the reason they happened.
- `ROADMAP.md` tracks future CI performance work that should preserve gate
  quality.

### Main CI (`ci.yaml`)

Runs on PRs and pushes to main:

- Typecheck + core/plugin tests
- Linting and formatting checks
- Build verification
- Dev startup + HMR propagation
- Interop TypeScript tests (`packages/interop`)

The broader `test.yml` orchestrator runs automatically on `develop` only to
avoid duplicating the main-branch CI gate. Secret-free deterministic zero-key
coverage for PRs to either protected branch is handled by `scenario-pr.yml`;
`test.yml` keeps the broader develop push/PR, manual, and scheduled coverage.

### Live E2E

PR E2E does not require `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or any other paid
provider key. Live/provider-key coverage belongs to the dedicated live jobs and
workflows (`cloud-live-e2e`, `provider-live-e2e`, `live-scenarios.yml`,
`scenario-matrix.yml`) where missing-key behavior is documented per lane.

## Code Review Workflows

### Claude Code Review (`claude-code-review.yml`)

Automated PR review using Claude. Checks for:

- Security issues (hardcoded keys, SQL injection, XSS)
- Test coverage
- TypeScript types (no `any`)
- Correct tooling (bun, vitest)

### Claude Security Review (`claude-security-review.yml`)

Dedicated security-focused review for code changes.

### Claude Interactive (`claude.yml`)

Responds to `@claude` mentions in issues and PRs.

## Documentation Workflows

### Docs CI (`docs-ci.yml`)

Documentation quality workflow:

- **Dead Link Checking:** Scans for broken internal/external links
- **Quality Checks:** Double headers, missing frontmatter, heading hierarchy

Automatically creates PRs with fixes when issues are found.

### JSDoc Automation (`jsdoc-automation.yml`)

Manual workflow for generating JSDoc documentation.

## Manual Release Process

1. Prepare a clean commit whose allowlisted manifests already contain the
   exact release version, public access metadata, and published internal semver
   ranges.
2. Dispatch `release.yaml` with that commit's full SHA, the canonical branch
   ref that currently resolves to it, the same exact semver, either `beta` or
   `latest`, and the npm username represented by the granular token. Beta
   requires prerelease semver; latest requires stable semver.
3. If a run is interrupted after candidate creation, dispatch with the same
   identity and the original `candidate_run_id`. The workflow downloads and
   verifies the recorded tarballs instead of rebuilding them.
4. Review the finalized candidate artifact. Its state must show npm staging,
   full integrity verification, public-channel promotion, exact tag
   publication, and GitHub Release readback in order.

Do not create the tag or GitHub Release first, and do not use Lerna/manual npm
publication as a recovery path. A retry resumes only exact recorded integrity.

## Setting Up Secrets

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | How to Get |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | NPM publishing | [npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude workflows | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Opt-in live/provider-key lanes | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |

### Optional Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `PHALA_CLOUD_API_KEY` | TEE deployment |
| `GH_PAT` | Cross-repo operations |

Turbo caching is GitHub-native (`.github/actions/turbo-cache-github` via
`setup-bun-workspace`) — no Vercel SaaS remote cache, so `TURBO_TOKEN` /
`TURBO_TEAM` are no longer used and are banned by
`ci-workflow-dedup-contract.mjs` (#12341).

## Package dependencies

`release.yaml` never discovers its publish set from Lerna. The allowlist in
`packages/scripts/release-cohort.json` is explicit and source-reviewed; the
candidate resolver proves every runtime workspace dependency is present and
orders the cohort before any registry mutation. A private, missing, wrong-
version, or incompatible runtime target fails candidate creation.

### Immutable npm candidate primitives

`packages/scripts/release-candidate.mjs` is the fail-closed boundary for the
transactional release workflow. Candidate creation requires an explicit JSON
allowlist (`{"schemaVersion":1,"packages":[...]}`), canonical repository and
branch-ref identities, a clean source SHA, the same expected commit, the exact
registry and publisher, exact semver/channel values, and one explicit build
command. The workflow proves the remote branch resolves to the checked-out SHA
immediately before and after packing. It runs that build once and invokes
`npm pack --ignore-scripts` once per package. An existing output directory is
never overwritten or repacked.

Each candidate directory contains `release-plan.json`, `release-state.json`,
and the immutable `tarballs/*.tgz` cohort. The plan records package directories,
hard-dependency ordering and ranges, entrypoint metadata, manifest integrity,
and both hexadecimal SHA-512 and npm SRI integrity for every tarball. A cohort
digest binds those package subjects and their dependency graph to the source,
repository, registry, and publisher; the candidate staging tag derives from
that digest. The complete canonical plan has a second digest that every later
job must present before it can mutate npm, Git, or GitHub. The state can advance
only through this sequence:

```
planned -> built-packed -> candidate-recorded -> registry-bound
        -> registry-staged -> registry-verified -> channel-promoted
        -> git-bound -> git-tagged -> release-published -> version-sync-pr
```

Registry publication first proves the token's `/-/whoami` identity equals the
planned publisher, then stages missing versions under a candidate-specific
tag. A retry accepts an existing version only when its `dist.integrity` exactly
matches the plan. npmjs metadata must also bind `_npmUser` and `gitHead` to the
planned publisher and source SHA; local registry fixtures that do not emit
those npmjs fields bind provenance through authenticated publisher identity
plus the exact candidate bytes. The workflow verifies the full cohort,
promotes the requested channel, and removes the staging tags. Only HTTP 404 is
absence; auth, throttling, transport, server, redirect, provenance, and parse
failures abort. A credential-free final read verifies every version, public
channel, provenance field, and removed candidate tag again before Git advances.
The normalized registry and resolved Git push destination are recorded before
their first external mutation, so an interrupted run cannot be resumed against
a different target. Git publication uses explicitly named refs, never
`--follow-tags`, and binds the resolved push destination before mutation.
The credential-bearing jobs execute release tooling checked out from
`github.workflow_sha`; the candidate source is a separate checkout used only as
verified data and as the exact Git repository for the final tag. Selecting a
different source SHA therefore cannot replace the script that receives the npm
or GitHub token. Candidate state writes use an exclusive owner lock; a dead
local owner or an expired cross-runner lease is recoverable without treating a
live writer as stale.

Finalization pushes only `refs/tags/v<exact-version>`; it never pushes a branch,
uses `--follow-tags`, rebases, or resolves conflicts automatically. The named
Git remote must resolve to the planned GitHub repository, and the planned
source commit must remain reachable from the planned branch. New annotated
tags use the fixed GitHub Actions bot identity and record the source, cohort,
and plan digests. A matching remote tag target is an idempotent retry and a
conflicting tag fails. The GitHub Release is then created or read back with the
candidate's exact repository, tag, target commit, and prerelease identity. One
fixed workflow concurrency group serializes all versions and channels.
`v2.0.3-beta.8`, `.9`, and `.10` are permanently reserved.

## Troubleshooting

### CI Failures

1. Check if tests pass locally: `bun run test`
2. Check formatting: `bun run format:check`
3. Check linting: `bun run lint`

### Release Failures

1. Verify secrets are configured
2. Check workflow logs for specific errors
3. For NPM: ensure package versions are unique

### Claude Workflow Issues

1. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
2. Check rate limits on Anthropic API
3. Review Claude's output in workflow logs
