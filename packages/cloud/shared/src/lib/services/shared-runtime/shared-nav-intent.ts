/**
 * Shared-runtime navigation intent — the Tier-0 fix for in-app navigation.
 *
 * A Tier-0 ("shared") agent runs container-free through `runSharedAgentTurn`,
 * which is a bare `generateText`/`streamText` with NO action pipeline and NO
 * plugins. The dedicated-runtime VIEWS action (plugin-app-control) — the thing
 * that turns "go to settings" into a real UI navigation — never loads there, so
 * before this module a shared agent answered every navigation command with a
 * hallucinated prose refusal ("I don't have a settings menu, I'm an AI…"). That
 * is the demo's "go to settings fails miserably" report (#F5-ACTIONS).
 *
 * The fix mirrors the dedicated runtime's deterministic fast path WITHOUT
 * booting any plugin: the SAME zero-model multilingual matcher the VIEWS action
 * uses (`@elizaos/shared/views/view-command-matcher`) resolves the utterance to
 * a matcher id, the shared nav-target table translates that to a CLIENT view
 * id, and the turn emits a VIEWS navigation handoff — the exact
 * `actionResults` summary shape the PWA already consumes
 * (`findViewActionHandoff` → `dispatchNavigateViewEvent` in
 * packages/ui/src/view-action-handoff.ts) — plus a short confirmation reply.
 * No LLM call, no plugin, no container: sub-millisecond and demo-safe.
 *
 * Scope: ONLY unambiguous navigation commands short-circuit here (the matcher is
 * precision-first — a bare noun needs an explicit nav signal). Everything else
 * returns null and falls through to the normal LLM turn, byte-identical to
 * today. This is intentionally the navigation slice of the "first 5 minutes"
 * strike; content actions (create a note, etc.) still need a real runtime.
