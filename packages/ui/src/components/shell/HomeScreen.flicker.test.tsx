/**
 * Home entrance-flicker lock (#9304).
 *
 * The `home-enter` fade (opacity 0→1) must play exactly ONCE on first mount and
 * never re-apply on a later re-render — re-applying it flashes the cards (a
 * fade-out-then-in excursion). This test locks both halves:
 *
 *  1. the `home-enter` class is present on the home blocks at first mount
 *     (so the entrance animation actually plays), and
 *  2. after the mount window, a re-render does NOT re-add `home-enter` — proven
 *     by sampling the opacity series and asserting `detectOpacityFlash` finds no
 *     re-trigger flash (the meta-tested flicker detector).
 *
 * Fails-when-broken: revert to the always-on `home-enter` class and step 2 sees
 * the class re-added on the re-render → the opacity series would flash → red.
