/**
 * Diff-scoped ratchet for the chat-first builtin-view contract.
 *
 * Builtin shell views may render buttons, toggles, filters, drag/drop handlers,
 * and form controls, but a user must be able to drive the same mutation through
 * a semantic agent action. Third-party plugin views use the generic
 * agent-surface bridge and are audited elsewhere; this file tracks only the
 * first-party pages bundled into the shell.
 *
 * Two checks compose the ratchet (#14369 shipped the first, #16944 the second):
 * the per-view coverage validator pins each baseline entry's mutation-site
 * count and verifies its semantic actions against the live registered-action
 * inventory, and the shell-page completeness sweep walks every module under
 * `packages/ui/src/components/pages` and fails when a mutating page is neither
 * claimed by a baseline entry nor exempt with a reason — so a brand-new
 * mutating view cannot ship un-ratcheted.
