/**
 * Post-upgrade agent-session recovery (#15132).
 *
 * When a dedicated cloud agent's container is upgraded (blue/green recreate,
 * fleet-upgrade #15101), the browser's persisted agent credential belongs to
 * the OLD container. Every agent-subdomain call then 401s and the top-level
 * auth gate would render the agent runtime's internal "Sign in with your
 * password" wall, a credential no cloud user possesses. With a valid cloud
 * session sitting right there, that wall is a terminal dead-end.
 *
 * This module makes the ROUTING decision: given the 401 reason, the active
 * runtime, and whether a cloud session exists, should the client transparently
 * re-run the pairing/token-swap (the same flow first-pairing uses) to refresh
 * the persisted agent credential, or is the password wall the honest state
 * (self-hosted direct access with no cloud session to re-pair from)?
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE (auth-adjacent): this weakens nothing. Re-pairing exchanges an
 * EXISTING valid cloud session for a fresh agent credential via the same
 * server-side pairing exchange that first-pairing uses. It never bypasses the
 * password wall, when there is no cloud session, the wall stands.
