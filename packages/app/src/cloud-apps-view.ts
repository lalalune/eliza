/**
 * In-process app-shell registration for the Eliza Cloud **Applications**
 * dashboard on native runtimes (iOS / Android / Electrobun desktop).
 *
 * On the web build the Applications surfaces are served by the top-level
 * `CloudRouterShell` `<BrowserRouter>` (mounted only when `__ELIZA_WEB_SHELL__`
 * is true). Native runtimes never mount that shell — the renderer boots the
 * tab/view `App` directly — so the same Applications components are surfaced
 * here as an in-process app-shell page that mounts the self-contained
 * `NativeAppsStudio` (a `MemoryRouter` + cloud providers + native Steward auth
 * context; see `@elizaos/ui/cloud/applications/NativeAppsStudio`).
 *
 * This uses the in-process app-shell registration mechanism (the same one
 * `orchestrator` / `wallet.inventory` use). It is gated to non-web platforms so
 * it never competes with the web shell's route, and the import stays **lazy**
 * (the studio chunk — and the whole applications domain it pulls — loads only
 * when the studio is opened), preserving the native bundle's tree-shake.
 *
 * The page id is `cloud-apps` (the local installed-`AppsView` owns `apps`), the
 * route is `/cloud-apps`, and the label is "Cloud Apps". The page is NOT a
 * launcher tile: My Apps is the one apps destination in the launcher
 * (`LAUNCHER_HIDDEN_IDS` in `@elizaos/ui`'s launcher-curation), and this route
 * is reached from the My Apps view's Eliza Cloud row and from deep links
 * (`eliza://apps/deploy` → `/cloud-apps`).
