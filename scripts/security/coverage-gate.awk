# coverage-gate.awk
#
# Parses LCOV output and confirms every changed executable source appears in
# coverage reporting. Percentages remain visible diagnostics but never gate CI.
#
# Usage:
#   awk -v changed="$CHANGED_FILES" \
#       [-v excluded="$LCOV_EXCLUDED_FILES"] \
#       -f scripts/security/coverage-gate.awk coverage/lcov.info
#
# `excluded` (newline-separated) lists files that CANNOT appear in an LCOV
# report (coverage collection fails on them; see
# scripts/security/coverage-lcov-excluded.txt, #16409). A changed file on that
# list that is absent from LCOV prints a visible EXCLUDED line instead of the
# fail-closed MISSING. If such a file DOES appear in LCOV (collection got
# fixed), it is gated normally — the escape hatch expires by itself.
